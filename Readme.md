# TODO
1. An In app floating guide to switch on the Accessibility Service for the app.
2. Credits Screen.
3. GitHub Screen.
4. Remove self from list of apps.
5. Remove system apps and launchers from list of apps.
6. Publish to playstore.

## How to use
Make sure you switch on the **Accessibility Service** for the app in the
accessibility menu. An in app floating guide for the same is coming soon.

## How does it work
The app uses an **Accessibility Service** to track the currently launched app and launches an app lock with an abusive message to *inspire* you to go back to work
